In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.
*/


select employee_id
from Employees
where salary < 30000 and manager_id IS NOT NULL and manager_id not in (select employee_id from Employees)
order by employee_id
