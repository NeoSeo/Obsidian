Solved aggregation analytic sql problems. Need to check difference of two queries

``` sql
select *

from

(

with temp_01 as

(

select oi.product_id, category_id, amount

, sum(amount) over (partition by oi.product_id) as total

, sum(amount) over (partition by category_id) as total_category

from order_items oi

join products p on p.product_id = oi.product_id

)

  

select category_id, product_id, a, b, round(a/b,2) as ratio

, row_number() over (partition by category_id order by a DESC) as RANKS

from
(
select category_id, product_id, avg(total) as a, avg(total_category) as b
from temp_01
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2
)
where a/b >= 0.05
)
where ranks in (1,2,3)

  

  

with
temp_01 as (
select a.product_id, max(b.category_id) as category_id , sum(amount) sum_by_prod
from order_items a
join products b
on a.product_id = b.product_id
group by a.product_id
),

temp_02 as (
select product_id, category_id, sum_by_prod
, sum(sum_by_prod) over (partition by category_id) as sum_by_cat
, row_number() over (partition by category_id order by sum_by_prod desc) as top_prod_ranking
from temp_01
)

select * from temp_02 where sum_by_prod >= 0.05 * sum_by_cat and top_prod_ranking <=3;

```
