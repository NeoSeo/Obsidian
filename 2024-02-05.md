Solved aggregation analytic sql problems. Need to check difference of two queries below

``` sql
-- 상품별 매출합을 구하되, 상품 카테고리별 매출합의 5% 이상이고, 동일 카테고리에서 상위 3개 매출의 상품 정보 추출.
-- 1. 상품별 + 상품 카테고리별 총 매출 계산. (상품별 + 상품 카테고리별 총 매출은 결국 상품별 총 매출임)
-- 2. 상품 카테고리별 총 매출 계산 및 동일 카테고리에서 상품별 랭킹 구함
-- 3. 상품 카테고리 매출의 5% 이상인 상품 매출과 매출 기준 top 3 상품 추출.

Learnt window parameters and difference between rows and range,
unbounded preceding, interval '2' day preceding, current row,unbounded following. 1 preceding, 1 following etc.

range required transformation into date/timestamp if needed
