Learnt from Growth Hacking 
- Growth Hacking is based on PMF(Product-Market Fit)
- PMF consists of Retention, Converstion, NPS
- NPS is recommendation ratio and calculated by the number of recommedation - not recommendation : (It's successful even if you have small positive number)
- Do NOT consider Install, Sign-up, Active user which is not critical for business. These are just consequential metrics
- To improve PMF, do NOT brain storming, add new features, improve retention, conversion, which is consequential.
- DO contact and listen to users. DO analyse user data
- Task based matrics can't offer what's important. Each team just attain because it's their metrics. 
- There could be missing task in task based
- NOT optimized for service/product
