[Monthly Transaction Leetcode](https://github.com/NeoSeo/Obsidian/blob/2200e8b86a489dd49589cc70a5c3038b31ac8780/SQL/pivot_example_2.sql) Failed because I used with clause to use left join, but null can't be joined
```sql
select left(trans_date, 7) as month
       , country, count(*) as trans_count
       , sum(if(state = 'approved',1,0)) as approved_count
       , sum(amount) as trans_total_amount
       , sum(if(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) as approved_total_amount
from Transactions
group by 1, 2
```
