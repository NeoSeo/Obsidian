## Attribution and window range
Attribution window range varies depending on channel or click/view type.
-> We have to decide them by our rigorous philosophy or mission/
The recent attribution is **NOT ALWAYS**  the best way than old ones. (ex. what is distribution ads in front of the store door?)
The click is **NOT ALWAYS** the best way than views (ex. If I wathced videos in instagram for 20secs? If I clicked ads by mistake due to large sudden popup?)
## ROAS
The big ROAS number is not that trustworthy source. Despite cut budget on marketing, return doesn't decrease as much as budget cut.
If we cut budget, ROAS usually soars (Is it really good?)

## Conclusion
- Focus on one channel only by start
- Pick best channel -> Optimization -> Saturate -> Extention with know-how
- Trend of channels changes by time
- **Narrowing UNKNOWN realm! DEEP DIVE
- Think how to measure marketing effect of channels

# SQL Analytic 

Using windows function, a table doesn't eliminate row levels unlike group by but we could aggregate or analyse the table by creating columns

## clause with rows / range clause
- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING – All rows before the current row.
- n PRECEDING – n rows before the current row.
- CURRENT ROW – Just the current row.
- n FOLLOWING – n rows after the current row.
- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING – All rows after the current row.

![[Example of range.png]]
## What if the second and the third are same.. 
- rank() over --- 1,2,2,4.... 
- dense_rank() over ---- 1,2,2,3....
- row_number() over ---- 1,2,3,4,....
Pleaes note window functions are not used for these clause. It doesn't required
## Null value processing
``` sql
rank() over (partition by deptno order by sal nulls last) -- basicially nulls first is default (showing null value as priorities)
```

## Analytic sql, Sum()
``` sql

select *
	   , sum(amount) over (partition by order_id) as total
	   , sum(amount) over (partition by order_id order by line_prod_seq) as cum_sum -- order by pros enables sum function to cumulate aggregation here
	   , sum(amount) over (partition by order_id order by line_prod_seq rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as cum_sum_2 -- same as previous clause, but if we change 1 preceding, it will aggregate from -1 row data to current row
	   , sum(amount) over () as total_2 -- aggregate all of amounts in the table	
from nw.order_items

```
When there is  order by clause, default window clause is 'range unbounded preceding and current row'
