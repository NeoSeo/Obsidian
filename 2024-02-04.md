# SQL Analytic

Using windows function, a table doesn't eliminate row levels unlike group by but we could aggregate or analyse the table by creating columns

## clause with rows / range clause
- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING – All rows before the current row.
- n PRECEDING – n rows before the current row.
- CURRENT ROW – Just the current row.
- n FOLLOWING – n rows after the current row.
- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING – All rows after the current row.

- row_number() over ---- 1,2,3,4,....
