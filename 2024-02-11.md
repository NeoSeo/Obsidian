## Retention 
[[Growth_Hacking/2-4 Retention.pdf|2-4 Retention]]
Basically measure retentino by re-visit rate. Good metrics for PMF!
- Classic retention: come-back rate at specific period (d+7/d+14/d+21..), Do not consider repetition within period, Very sensitive at noise(What if loyal customer didn't visit d-7?), Set multiple base dates and measure multiple times and do average them. (Jan/1st&D+7 and Jan/2nd&D+7), Good metrics for daily user(calendar, phone service)
- Range retention: Measure weekly period or monthly period, Do no consider repetition
