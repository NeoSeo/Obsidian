## Retention 
[[Growth_Hacking/2-4 Retention.pdf|2-4 Retention]]
Basically measure retentino by re-visit rate. Good metrics for PMF!
- Classic retention: come-back rate at specific period (d+7/d+14/d+21..), Do not consider repetition within period, Very sensitive at noise(What if loyal customer didn't visit d-7?), Set multiple base dates and measure multiple times and do average them. (Jan/1st&D+7 and Jan/2nd&D+7), Good metrics for daily user(calendar, phone service)
- Range retention: Measure weekly period or monthly period, Do no consider repetition, Just count one within a week or a month if customer visited once or more. Free from noise, but over-estimate risk(Just one count for multiple visits like loyal users?)
- Rolling retention: Count how many signing out, Not left customers.

Engagement: DAU/MAU ratio
- Use only for defined daily use app. Break down retained user and unretainted user.
- But every sector has different definition of DAU/MAU

### It is VERY IMPORTANT to analyze retention with Cohort (signup date, first purchase etc)

What is definition of Retention?
- only loggin?
- Click or Use core function, Visit more than 5 pages, click purchase, message, watch contents...

## Improve retention
-  **Do not push too much -> It will lead to uninstall (Just temporary effect)
- Unify user communication channels. (Google play, Kakao, Email etc)
