Conversion rate in funnel is the key metrics of activation. 
How to improve?
- Well defined each stage
- Choose right method to measure
- segmented cohort in detail and specifically
- Do NOT see just conversion rate from each channel, See which channel shows change rate when condition(promotion, date, mobile/desktop) changes. EVEN 1~2% is able to be MEANINGFUL!
- Find the reason by user interview
- Try to reduce unnecessary stage // Reverse funnel (prepay -> delivery => delivery -> postpay)
