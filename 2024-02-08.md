Conversion rate in funnel is the key metrics of activation. 
How to improve?
- Well defined each stage
- Choose right method to measure
- segmented cohort in detail and specifically
- Do NOT see just conversion rate from each channel, See which channel shows change rate when condition(promotion, date, mobile/desktop) changes. EVEN 1~2% is able to be MEANINGFUL!
- Find the reason by user interview
- Try to reduce unnecessary stage // Reverse funnel (prepay -> delivery => delivery -> postpay)

# SQL Analytic
``` sql
select empno, deptno, sal
, avg(sal) over (partition by deptno order by sal) as avg_default -- range와 동일
, avg(sal) over (partition by deptno order by sal range between unbounded preceding and current row) as avg_range -- 같은 sal값이 있으면 동일하게 취급해서 보여준다. 
, avg(sal) over (partition by deptno order by sal rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as avg_rows -- 같은 sal값이 있어도 하나씩 처리해도 보여준다.
, sum(sal) over (partition by deptno order by sal) as sum_default
, sum(sal) over (partition by deptno order by sal rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as sum_rows
